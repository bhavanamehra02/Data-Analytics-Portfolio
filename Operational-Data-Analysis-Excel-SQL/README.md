# Operational Data Analysis – Excel & SQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing structured operational datasets using Excel and SQL. The objective was to clean and validate raw data, analyze efficiency metrics, and produce clear summary reports to support management decision-making.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Pivot Tables)
- SQL (MySQL)

## Dataset Description
The dataset consisted of structured operational records such as transaction logs and performance metrics stored in tabular format. The data required cleaning and validation before analysis.

## Data Cleaning & Validation
- Checked for missing values and duplicate records
- Standardized data formats and column values
- Validated numeric fields and consistency across records

## Analysis Approach
- Used SQL queries to extract and aggregate key metrics
- Applied GROUP BY, COUNT, and AVG functions to analyze trends
- Used Excel Pivot Tables to compare performance across categories
- Identified patterns and efficiency metrics relevant to operations

## Key Insights
- Identified trends in operational performance
- Highlighted areas where efficiency could be improved
- Created clear summaries to support data-driven decisions

## Outcome
The final output included structured summary reports that presented key metrics and trends in a clear and easy-to-understand format for management review.
